# General Idea
My research focuses on the role of government in the creation of Logistic Clusters.
Logistic clusters can be defined as centers that concentrate economic and distribution activities.
I want to assess if government intervention and funding can improve the chances of creating successful logistic clusters or whether logistic clusters are formed independently of government investment.
I can assess this by analyzing state budgets in order to identify government investment in logic clusters, and compare it with the number of companies that join the cluster, number of freight means, and amount of trade of goods.  
# Null Hypothesis
Government's investments in logistic clusters reduces or does not affect the posibility formation of logistic clusters. 
# Alternative Hypothesis
Government's investments in logistic clusters increase the possibility of the formation of logistic cluster. 
# Comments on Experimental Design
This research will require identifying as many logistic clusters as possible in the United States. For each cluster, the following features will be assessed: 

  -State in which the cluster is located

  -Number of companies

  -Private investment

  -Government investment

  -Number of freight trains, freight rails, and freight trucks bases

  -Closeness to highways

  -Closeness to freight airports

  -Amount of trade

  -Importance of the cluster

For each state, I will identify:

  -Has the state invested in the foramtion of logistic cluseters?

This will be assessed by analyzing state budgets. I would use some text mining techniques to see which states have invested in logistic clusters or logistic services.

  -Inverstment over time

  -Logistic infraestructure

Some of the barriers that I will be face will be:

  -State goverments do not follow a standard budget structure. This means that each budget will look very different, so data cleaning will be intensive and I will have to construct or adampt many lines of budget.

  -I am not considering federal investments. In the future, I will have to research literature on the role of federal investment on logistic clusters.

  -Local governments can also influence these logistic clusters.
