1 - what the homework was about in your own words

The homework consisted of the analysis of a dataframe with information of parks in Philadelphia. Each park had different characteristics, but the homework focused specifically on the size of the park measured in Acres.
I analyzed some of the measures of central tendency (mean, median, and standard deviation), and several histograms. It seemed that the data was skewed by some outliers that have very large sizes and significantly affected the mean of the data.
